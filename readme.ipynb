    "## **Road Accident Severity Prediction**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Project Selection**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem Statement:**\n",
    "- Predict the severity of road accidents (Slight, Serious, Fatal) using environmental, human, and vehicle-related factors. (from road, weather, driver, and vehicle features.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why chosen:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Road safety is a major global challenge.\n",
    "- Fatal accidents are rare but devastating. Predicting severity can help with preventive policies.\n",
    "- Identifying risk factors can help policymakers design better interventions.\n",
    "- Dataset is rich, real-world, and publicly available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type of ML Task:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Classification (multi-class).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Who benefits?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Transport authorities (NTSA, UK Dept of Transport)\n",
    "- Emergency responders\n",
    "- Road safety planners\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Data Collection & Understanding**\n",
    "\n",
    "Source: UK STATS19 Road Safety Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Tables used:\n",
    "- Collisions (road & environment factors)\n",
    "- Casualties (human factors)\n",
    "- Vehicles (vehicle details)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exploration:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data types: mix of categorical (weather, light, road surface) and numerical (speed limit, age).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Missing values present in some fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Severe class imbalance (Fatal ≪ Slight).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Outliers: extreme ages, invalid speed values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**EDA visualizations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Severity distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Accidents by time of day.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Correlation between road conditions & severity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Data Preprocessing**\n",
    "\n",
    "Handle missing values (impute with mode/median, “Unknown” for categories).\n",
    "\n",
    "Encode categorical variables (One-Hot or Label encoding).\n",
    "\n",
    "Normalize/standardize numerical features if required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Address imbalanced target (use SMOTE oversampling + class weights).\n",
    "\n",
    "Split into Train (70%) / Test (30%) sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Modeling**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Baseline models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Advanced models: Random Forest, XGBoost.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compare performance across models.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use GridSearchCV / RandomizedSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Select best-performing model (tradeoff between accuracy & interpretability).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Evaluation**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Metrics:**\n",
    "- Accuracy\n",
    "- Precision, Recall, F1 (macro average for multi-class)\n",
    "- Confusion matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model diagnostics:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Validation curves (e.g., depth in trees).\n",
    "- Learning curves (detect underfitting/overfitting).\n",
    "- Feature importance: Identify top contributors to severity (e.g., weather, light, speed limit).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. Error Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "Confusion matrix to see which severities are most confused.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fatal vs Serious often misclassified (due to low fatal samples).\n",
    "\n",
    "Errors higher during rare conditions (e.g., fog).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reasons:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Imbalanced classes (few fatal samples).\n",
    "\n",
    "Some features are noisy or incomplete.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Improvements:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Collect more balanced data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Engineer features (rush hour, weekend/weekday, rural/urban).\n",
    "\n",
    "Try ensemble models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **7. Model Interpretation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Tree-based feature importance: e.g., road type, speed limit, light conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "SHAP values: show how individual features contribute to predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plain explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "“Accidents on wet roads at night are more likely to be serious/fatal.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Higher speed limits correlate with more severe accidents.”\n",
    "\n",
    "### **8. Deployment**\n",
    "\n",
    "Build a Streamlit app:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input accident conditions → Output predicted severity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Show top contributing features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, deliver a documented Jupyter Notebook.\n",
